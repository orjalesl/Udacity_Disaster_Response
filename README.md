## Background

Natural disasters require immediate action to attend victims in need; the issue being that first-responder teams are fluded with communications and typically do not have the necessary resources to cover all requests. This project was motivated to create a tool to:
1. Identify messages that require a first-responder team dispatch
2. Classify input messages into specific disaster categories

## Installation
  The libraries used in this project are all native to Anaconda enviroment. The following libraries were used for the project:
```bash
# libraries for data
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
  
# libraries for NLP
import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer

# libraries for Modeling
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# library for scoring
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
```

## Instructions
### Terminal
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run web app: `python run.py`

4. Click the `PREVIEW` button to open the homepage

### HTML
The web app will take the input of a user and predict the response categories highlighted in green.

## Files
There are 2 files used in the project:
1. 'disaster_messages.csv' - comprised of messages used to train the model
2. 'disaster_categories.csv' - comprised of the disaster categories used to label the messages and used as the target variables.

The data in the 'disaster_messages' file has its imbalances, as seen in the graph on the web app. These imbalances affect the training model for those specific categories since the model does not have sufficient labels to learn from the data.

## Consideration
When running the model, it is important to consider which score to maximize. **Precision** should be maximized if the cost for dispatching first-responder team is high for the decision-maker. **Recall** should be maximized if the cost of not helping to someone in need is high for the decision-maker.
